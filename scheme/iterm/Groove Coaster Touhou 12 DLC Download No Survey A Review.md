Groove Coaster is a popular rhythm game that lets you enjoy various music genres and styles. If you are a fan of Touhou Project, a series of bullet hell shooter games with a huge fanbase, you might be interested in getting the Groove Coaster Touhou 12 DLC, which adds 12 songs from the Touhou Project series to the game.
  
However, if you want to download the Groove Coaster Touhou 12 DLC from Steam, you will have to pay $35.07 for the bundle that includes the main game and the DLC[^1^]. That's quite expensive for some people who just want to enjoy some Touhou music in Groove Coaster. Is there a way to get the Groove Coaster Touhou 12 DLC for free without survey?

The answer is yes, but you will have to be careful and follow some steps. Here is how to do it:
  
1. First, you will need to download the Groove Coaster main game from Steam. You can get it for $19.99 or wait for a sale or a discount coupon. You will also need a Steam account and a good internet connection.
2. Next, you will need to find a reliable source for the Groove Coaster Touhou 12 DLC files. You can search online for websites or forums that offer free downloads of Steam games and DLCs. However, be wary of scams, viruses, malware, and fake links that might harm your computer or steal your personal information. Always check the reviews, ratings, and comments of other users before downloading anything.
3. Once you have found a trustworthy source, download the Groove Coaster Touhou 12 DLC files to your computer. Make sure they are compatible with your version of Groove Coaster and Steam. You might need to unzip or extract them using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
4. After downloading the files, you will need to copy them to your Groove Coaster game folder. To do this, go to your Steam library, right-click on Groove Coaster, and select Properties. Then, go to the Local Files tab and click on Browse Local Files. This will open your Groove Coaster game folder in a new window.
5. In your Groove Coaster game folder, look for a subfolder called "dlc". If it doesn't exist, create one. Then, paste the Groove Coaster Touhou 12 DLC files that you downloaded into this subfolder.
6. Finally, launch Groove Coaster from Steam and enjoy playing with the Touhou 12 DLC songs. You can check if they are installed by going to the Music Select screen and looking for the Touhou Project logo on the song thumbnails.
