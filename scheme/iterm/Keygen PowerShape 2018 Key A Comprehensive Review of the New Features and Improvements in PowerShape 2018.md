The Cavalieri dello Zodiaco is an anime adaptation of the Japanese manga Saint Seiya by Masami Kurumada, which was first published in 1986 and ran for 114 episodes. The anime follows the plot of the manga, with some minor changes and additions. The story revolves around the battles of the Saints, young warriors who wear sacred armors called Cloths, each one representing a constellation of the zodiac. The Saints are sworn to protect Athena, the reincarnated goddess of wisdom and war, from the evil forces that want to destroy her and the world. Seiya is one of the Saints who wears the Pegasus Cloth, and he is joined by his friends and fellow Saints: Shiryu, who wears the Dragon Cloth; Hyoga, who wears the Cygnus Cloth; Shun, who wears the Andromeda Cloth; and Ikki, who wears the Phoenix Cloth. Together, they face various enemies and challenges, such as the Black Saints, the Silver Saints, the Gold Saints, and the Specters of Hades.
