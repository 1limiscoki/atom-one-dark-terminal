## What is Image-Line DirectWave?
 
Image-Line DirectWave is a sampler plugin that can be used as a standalone application or as a VST plugin in any compatible host software, such as FL Studio, Ableton Live, Cubase, or Logic Pro. It allows you to load any audio file format and play it across the keyboard, or use multiple samples for each key to create realistic instruments. You can also edit the samples with various tools, such as looping, slicing, cropping, fading, pitch-shifting, time-stretching, filtering, and more.
 
Image-Line DirectWave also has a synth engine that lets you create your own sounds using oscillators, envelopes, filters, LFOs, modulation matrix, effects, and arpeggiator. You can use the synth engine to enhance the samples or to generate completely new sounds from scratch. You can also layer up to 16 programs (samples or synth sounds) in one patch and assign them to different MIDI channels or keyboard zones.
